🚗 Smart Adaptive PID Line Following Robot with Obstacle Intelligence 🤖
📌 Project Overview

This project implements a PID-based autonomous line-following robot using an Arduino Nano.
Unlike traditional line followers that rely on simple conditional logic, this system uses closed-loop PID control to ensure smooth, stable, and adaptive navigation.

Additionally, the robot integrates ultrasonic obstacle detection, enabling intelligent environmental awareness.

⚙️ Working Principle
1️⃣ Line Detection

IR sensors detect contrast between black line and white surface.

Black surface → Low reflection

White surface → High reflection

Sensor data is converted into a positional error value.

2️⃣ PID Control Logic

The correction value is calculated using:

𝑂

)
Output=(Kp×error)+(Ki×integral)+(Kd×derivative)

Motor speeds are dynamically adjusted:

Left Motor Speed  = Base Speed - Correction
Right Motor Speed = Base Speed + Correction

This ensures:

Smooth turns

Reduced oscillation

Faster response

3️⃣ Adaptive Speed Mechanism

The robot reduces speed on curves:

baseSpeed = MAX_SPEED - abs(error) * factor;

This increases stability during sharp turns.

4️⃣ Obstacle Intelligence

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance:

Distance=(Time×0.034)/2

If obstacle distance < threshold:
